# Node Auth Microserver

## Description

Simple microserver implementing token-based authentication.

In my opinion it is not purely OAuth, but it works as expected :)

## Warning

Not ready for production, a few tweaks would be required to enable production use.

## Technologies

- nodejs/babel(esnext)/eslint(standard)
- express
- passportjs
- oauth2orize
- sequelize
